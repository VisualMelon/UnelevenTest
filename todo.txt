UnEleven

Short term:
 - work out technique groups and stuff (i.e. litTech, lightTech, etc.)
 - ticker (put it in the UN11 inst)

Features:
 - drawBatched
 - lightmapped lights
 - time based animation
 - uninterface (a slide - this could be really nice)

Long Term:
 - Improve constant buffer register usage (write a new "buffer" that lets you glue together CDatas, or just glue them together, or something)
